This is my first web application, so it is going to be a little messy! It will be a work-in-progress for a while. It is a site for my Mom who would like to give credit to the "Quiet Good-Doers" or the world. Inspirational books, blog posts, resources, and heroes will be continually updated.

Bear with me as I try to make everything work and THEN I will clean it all up to make the code pretty :)

(In the future, I will make an effort to create "clean" code from the beginning)
